<p>This assignment answers a number of questions about the Activity Monitoring Data dataset (included in the git repository). Below I document the questions as well as the steps taken to answer them. Because I used RStudio, the knitr package was built into the environment.</p>

<p>The variables included in this dataset are:</p>

<li><p>interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken</p></li>

<p>Since I previously calculated the mean for each of the intervals above, I used these values to impute the missing data. More specifically, I computed which rows (indices) of the original dataset contained NAs. Then created a new column filled with the average associated with the interval for the row. Finally, for each of the indices of na.indices, replace the steps (NA) with the value in ave.steps.</p>

<p>The difference between this value (computed with imputed data) and the original (with NAs removed) is: <em>-375</em>.</p>
<p>This shows that imputing the data increases the average and median number of steps results. Using this data in further calculations is more reasonable than using zeros as the data for the NA time periods, as it is more likely the device was turned off than that the person did not take any steps during those times.</p>
